3,"It has been good for most of the times but right now it is very very slow. Loading a playlist take so much time I end up leaving the app and rather play a track on YouTube. Deezer is very slow!

7,"This service isnt too bad, I dont pull up Spotify nearly as much anymore other than for some of my bigger playlists that Im just to lazy to remake on this service.

9,The shuffle is horrific. It plays the same songs over and over again and never ever plays other songs in the playlist. It also has more adverts than Spotify.

10,"Pretty solid but definitely not perfect. Some songs are missing lyrics option, or explisive tracks.

Favorite songs limits...\nFull Review",Strength

42,I only rate with one star because I wasnt allowed to rate with no stars. I really hate this app. It has a nasty habit of playing random songs from different artists when all you want to do is listen to a particular album from a particular artist! Please fix this or I WILL delete it!,Weakness
43,"I have used this app enough that i got around 1405 tracks in my favourites. Everytime i try to use the favourites section, it either takes a minute to load or doesnt load at all. For a while, the app has just been a struggle which isnt nice cus i love this app. Please fix this.",Weakness

55,Garbage. I spent hours placing bands and songs I like to listen to. The deezer app plays more songs and artists I did not select to my favorites. The bands and songs you select to favorites the app only plays one song and only the one song by that band. Horrible app not worth the data usage.,Strength
